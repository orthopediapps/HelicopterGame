# HelicopterGame
Final Project create with code


Created by PITAPA as part of the checkpoint for the mission checkpoint, JUNIOR PROGRAMMER PATHWAY, Unity Learn.

It consists on a game where you control a rescue helicopter and pickup castaways before they drown. 

The four Pillars of OOP are represented this way:
ABSTRACTION
Simplified code overall the project, whenever I could. 

INHERITANCE
There are three kind of sailors. Each of them is a different prefab with different behavior but they all depend on a class called DrownTimer.

POLYMORPHISM
Time till the sailors drawn is different, overriding a method.

There are other examples of inheritance and polymorphism

ENCAPSULATION
There is a powerUp that speeds up the helicopter on a random basis for a specific amount of time. The random new speed varies between 100 and 200
But the speed of the helicopter is limited by a {get : set} which limits the maximum speed to 150.

Hope it is as fun as making it!
